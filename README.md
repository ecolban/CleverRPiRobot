#CleverRPiRobot

This project is a basis for a program that controls the _iRobot Create 2_ from another computer, e.g. a Raspberry Pi. In order to use this program, the _source_ of [RPiGreenbot](https://github.com/jointheleague/RPiGreenbot) needs to be referenced in the class path (see [.classpath](https://github.com/jointheleague/CleverRPiRobot/blob/master/.classpath)). Read the [README](https://github.com/jointheleague/RPiGreenbot/blob/master/README.md) of that project for further requirements for installation.

Generate a runnable jar file and deploy the jar file to the computer controlling the Create 2. Run the program with `java -jar CleverRPiRobot.jar`.
